# javascript testing site

hai
i use this site to test random things my slow brain can think of when coding
its my way of learning the language thats surprisingly more difficult that pico 8's lua ðŸ˜­

if you are seeing the source code and you want to go to the website [click here](https://nexuster.github.io/js-test)

im also gonna try to use this website for html and css testing aswell

## current things im working on
#### these will be crossed off when im done (~strikethrough~)
- ~~dropdowns that send to specific websites using "value=" (probably gonna be used for choose which test)~~
- ~~url parameters because who doesnt like using those~~
